This project is based on the Kaggle Spaceship Titanic dataset. The goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster using various machine learning techniques.

## Learnings

- **Data Mining:** Techniques for extracting useful information from large datasets.
- **Understanding Data Correlation:** Analyzing how different features are related.
- **Preprocessing:** Applying methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to prepare data for modeling.
- **Feature Extraction:** Identifying and extracting relevant features to improve model performance.

## Results

The project includes various visualizations and model performance metrics to evaluate the predictions.
